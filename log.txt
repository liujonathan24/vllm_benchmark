I would be really grateful if you give me some tips on what to read and what to do first.\nIn my understanding, one of the hardest things about programming GPU's is not knowing what exactly you're going to do with it in the first place, and how to get there. The GPU is, fundamentally, a parallelized matrix math coprocessor. Your first priority should be to find out what you want to do, and what matrix math will get you there. I'm not sure if you mean you have an actual project, or just want to tinker with the thing, but I'll go ahead and assume you have a project.\nThere are a couple of basic things you'll have to do. You'll have to determine what is the size of the problem you're trying to solve (the size of the matrix), and you'll have to determine how to break up that problem into smaller problems (say, instead of solving one 100x100 problem, you solve 25 20x20 problems, and then sum up the results). Once you have that, you can determine how many threads you're going to"
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " The best method I have is to use the same class of computer for both, but that is not always possible.\nIt is possible to keep the same code for both, but you'll need to abstract the GPU code from the CPU code a bit, by wrapping it in a class that provides an abstract API for the GPU. This is a bit of work, but it is work that pays off.\nIf you have an Nvidia GPU, then I highly recommend that you read this post about writing CUDA code that uses fast memory and the PCIe bus. I am surprised at how much difference it makes, compared to writing code that uses global memory (which is essentially RAM attached to the GPU).\nI think that it is worth doing some work to abstract the GPU code from the CPU code, but that's only if you are targeting Nvidia GPUs. If you target AMD GPUs, then you might need to keep the GPU code separate from the CPU code.\nIf you are targeting Intel GPUs, then you need to consider using the GPU as a co-processor (i.e. using the CPU and GPU in parallel). The Intel GPUs have more memory and bandwidth than Nvidia GPUs, so you might get better results.\nI am not sure how much better you can get, but I think it's worth"

If you declare a vector of 4 floats, you could do the following:\nYou could declare another vector of 4 floats, and store the result in it:\nAnd you could do the following:\nThe first method is the most efficient, as it just moves the data around with a simple memcpy. The second is much slower, but it is more flexible. The third is the most flexible, but much slower.\nIf you want to apply the same operation to two vectors, but store the results in two different vectors, you would want to use the 2nd or 3rd method.\nThere's also a function called memcpy. It copies the memory of one vector to another. You can use it with pointers, or with vectors. For example, to copy one vector to another, you would use:\nWith vectors, you can use the copy function, which copies the data of one vector to another. It's similar to memcpy, but it takes an extra parameter for the number of elements to copy:\nThat's it. Now, just to note that memcpy, memmove, and copy are all members of the C++ Standard Library.

This will help you make a better choice.\nI was surprised to find that many of the people who claim to be experts in the GPU are also experts in the CPU.

My first build is a RX 480, and this is a new CPU for me.   I am thinking about getting a new CPU as well. The RX 580 is a really nice CPU, but I am curious about the performance of an upgrade to the RX 570.\nWhen I get mine I'll be reusing my old RX 580 card. Do you think you can use the 970 at 1080p or just go with the 1080p card?\nI think it would be a good idea to use the 970. I use the 1080p on my 8gb of ram, and the 970 runs better. I plan to upgrade the 1070 to it as well.   What kind of cards do you have?"
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " What's the best way to make sure the hardware is where it should be?\nI agree with this guy. I have a GPU and I have never had any problems with it. I only had a problem with one button being limited and when I used it to aim and it would not start. I removed the button. So the problem is solved."

If you want to go up to higher end cards, you can get a 2nd gen card in the same price range (though I wouldn't recommend that in the first place)."

I would be really grateful if you give me some tips on what to read and what to do first.\nIn my understanding, one of the hardest things about programming GPU's is not knowing what exactly you're going to do with it in the first place, and how to get there. The GPU is, fundamentally, a parallelized matrix math coprocessor. Your first priority should be to find out what you want to do, and what matrix math will get you there. I'm not sure if you mean you have an actual project, or just want to tinker with the thing, but I'll go ahead and assume you have a project.\nThere are a couple of basic things you'll have to do. You'll have to determine what is the size of the problem you're trying to solve (the size of the matrix), and you'll have to determine how to break up that problem into smaller problems (say, instead of solving one 100x100 problem, you solve 25 20x20 problems, and then sum up the results). Once you have that, you can determine how many threads you're going to"

This is a bit of work, but it is work that pays off.\nIf you have an Nvidia GPU, then I highly recommend that you read this post about writing CUDA code that uses fast memory and the PCIe bus. I am surprised at how much difference it makes, compared to writing code that uses global memory (which is essentially RAM attached to the GPU).\nI think that it is worth doing some work to abstract the GPU code from the CPU code, but that's only if you are targeting Nvidia GPUs. If you target AMD GPUs, then you might need to keep the GPU code separate from the CPU code.\nIf you are targeting Intel GPUs, then you need to consider using the GPU as a co-processor (i.e. using the CPU and GPU in parallel). The Intel GPUs have more memory and bandwidth than Nvidia GPUs, so you might get better results.\nI am not sure how much better you can get, but I think it's worth"

It copies the memory of one vector to another. You can use it with pointers, or with vectors. For example, to copy one vector to another, you would use:\nWith vectors, you can use the copy function, which copies the data of one vector to another. It's similar to memcpy, but it takes an extra parameter for the number of elements to copy:\nThat's it. Now, just to note that memcpy, memmove, and copy are all members of the C++ Standard Library.

Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " That is my main problem, i can't find anything with practical tips for what i need.\nThe thing with GPUs is that they are technically expensive and they are difficult to use in that way. The simpler way to do this is to run a bare minimum of RAM and a CPU. It is the cheapest way to do this."
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " I've got a new PC and I'd like to learn more about how to apply it.\nI think you should give it a shot. I don't know how to do it myself. But I'm sure you'll find it useful.\nThank you very much.\nNo problem. What platform do you play on?"
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: '\nhow would you do that\nJust give me a suggestion.\nthe only way i can think of is to try and get all the blocks that you want to run in the simulator.  this would require like, 10 hours and a bit of time.  then you would have to run the simulator.   iirc it is fairly difficult to do that without getting yourself into trouble (and most importantly a lot of time).'

I am looking for a new CPU for my RX580 and I am looking for a new GPU for my GPU. I am looking for a new CPU for my RX580.\nI am currently developing a new GPU for my RX580.   My first build is a RX 480, and this is a new CPU for me.   I am thinking about getting a new CPU as well. The RX 580 is a really nice CPU, but I am curious about the performance of an upgrade to the RX 570.\nWhen I get mine I'll be reusing my old RX 580 card. Do you think you can use the 970 at 1080p or just go with the 1080p card?\nI think it would be a good idea to use the 970. I use the 1080p on my 8gb of ram, and the 970 runs better. I plan to upgrade the 1070 to it as well.   What kind of cards do you have?"
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " What's the best way to make sure the hardware is where it should be?\nI agree with this guy. I have a GPU and I have never had any problems with it. I only had a problem with one button being limited and when I used it to aim and it would not start. I removed the button. So the problem is solved."
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " I don't have experience in these matters.\nThere are tons of posts on /r/gcc and /r/buildapc.  I know that the type of instructions are rather general, but they are great for helping you out.  For instance, you might want to look into getting a good new GPU driver for your mobo, then run a test program to see what your requirements are."
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: "  I have a higher level GPU but I need to know if it’s worth it to upgrade to a higher level or just upgrade it for the sake of it?  Thanks!\nYou can get a better GPU for the price if you upgrade it, but the performance is also not that great. If you want to go up to higher end cards, you can get a 2nd gen card in the same price range (though I wouldn't recommend that in the first place)."
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " Thank you!\nFor a beginner i recommend learning the basics of the NVIDIA GPU, it will help you learn more about and get you to a more comfortable level of computing, its very intuitive.\nThis is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!\nNo problem, as always. I'd suggest watching some tutorials on youtube and other tutorials on how to optimize your GPU. I know this is off topic but my advice would be to just use it as an example."
Prompt: 'Hi, tell me a piece of useful and actionable advice on triton and GPU programming.', Generated text: " I'm currently doing Windows, but I'm thinking about doing something similar.\ndon't put more than a couple of years of experience into triton.\nWell I do know a bit about it, but the triton it comes with is terrible and I've never been a huge fan of the architecture behind it.\nI have a 6970 so I know things well. Triton is super easy to learn. Especially if you are learning from it."

I think I'm looking for someone who can give me some inspiration.  I know it's not really a great article, but I really have to look into it.\nIt's a good article. I'd just advise you to read it. It's really not that bad.  If you're looking for advice on tritons go for the ATmega328. It's got a lot of useful information and really great advice."
